        "# Exploring the Power of Vertex AI Gemini\n",
        "\n",
        "Copyright 2024, Denis Rothman\n",
        "\n",
        "Release date: Juin 1,2024\n",
        "\n",
        "October 28, 2024. Timer added for Google Vertex AI rate usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important Note:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Check Costs and Quotas:** Before running this notebook, be sure to review the cost of using the Vertex AI API and your project's quotas to avoid unexpected expenses.\n",
        "* **Google Cloud Project:**  Ensure you have a Google Cloud project with the Vertex AI API enabled. You'll need to replace `\"aiex-57523\"` and `\"us-central1\"` in the code with your actual project ID and region.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "Google, like other tech giants, is rapidly advancing in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI.  The **Gemini** family of models is a testament to Google's commitment to pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve.\n",
        "\n",
        "This Colab notebook showcases the impressive capabilities of the Gemini model across a wide range of tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  Gemini tackles complex questions in science, philosophy, history, law, economics, and more. It can even write creative stories and analyze literature.\n",
        "* **Technical Challenges:**  Gemini demonstrates proficiency in code generation, technical problem-solving, and medical diagnosis.\n",
        "* **Social and Cultural Insights:**  The model delves into social commentary, environmental analysis, linguistics, and even art interpretation.\n",
        "* **Computer Vision:** We'll leverage Gemini's understanding of images to analyze a famous painting by Salvador Dalí.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model Versions**\n",
        "\n",
        "Google is continuously updating and improving its models.  It's important to be aware of the specific model version you're using. If you encounter any issues, refer to Google's [Model Versioning documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/model-versioning) for guidance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bigframes Note**\n",
        "\n",
        "A recent update to the BigFrames library (1.0.1) might conflict with the Vertex AI SDK. For this notebook, we'll use an earlier version (`bigframes==0.26.0`). If you have issues, try restarting your Colab session after installing this version.\n",

              "<li><strong>Economic Transformation:</strong> The Industrial Revolution ushered in an era of unprecedented economic growth and technological advancements. Mass production, fueled by steam power and later electricity, spurred the rise of factories, increased productivity, and transformed agricultural practices. Capitalism, with its emphasis on private ownership and free markets, flourished, leading to significant wealth creation and the emergence of new social classes.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Urbanization and Population Growth:</strong>  The demand for labor in factories drove mass migration from rural areas to burgeoning industrial cities, leading to rapid urbanization and unprecedented population growth. This created challenges like overcrowding, sanitation issues, and social unrest, but also spurred innovation in infrastructure, housing, and public services.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Social Change:</strong> The Industrial Revolution reshaped social structures, creating a new middle class of factory owners, managers, and professionals, while also fostering a working class of industrial laborers. These shifts challenged traditional hierarchies and led to social movements advocating for worker rights, education, and political representation.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Globalized Economy:</strong> Technological advancements, particularly in transportation, fueled global trade and interconnectedness. Industrial powers like Britain, France, and Germany established colonial empires, exploiting resources and markets worldwide, leading to uneven development and global inequalities.</li>\n",

              "<li><strong>Technology:</strong>  Without the rapid advancements in steam power, electricity, and other innovations, technological development would likely have proceeded at a much slower pace.  We might have seen incremental improvements in existing technologies, perhaps driven by water power, wind power, or animal labor.  The internal combustion engine, the automobile, and modern computing might not have existed in their current form.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Economic Systems:</strong> The absence of mass production might have slowed the growth of capitalism and perhaps prolonged pre-industrial economic systems, such as mercantilism, feudalism, or agrarian economies. This might have resulted in less wealth creation, but also potentially less inequality and exploitation. </li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Social Structures:</strong>  Without the urbanization and social upheavals brought about by the Industrial Revolution, social hierarchies and traditional power structures might have remained more stable. However, without the mass production and availability of consumer goods, the emergence of a middle class might have been delayed or altered.</li>\n",

This could have resulted in lower strain on resources but also slower technological development.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Limited Global Interconnectedness:</strong> Without the advancements in transportation and communication, the world might be less interconnected, with less international trade and limited cultural exchange. This could have led to more isolated societies, potentially limiting the spread of knowledge and ideas.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Delayed Social Progress:</strong> The social movements and reforms that emerged as a response to the Industrial Revolution might have been delayed or perhaps never occurred. This could have meant a slower pace of progress towards gender equality, worker rights, and other social justice issues.</li>\n",

As I held it up, the blue light intensified, illuminating a small, swirling vortex forming on the dusty floor. Hesitantly, I touched the key to the swirling air. A jolt of energy shot up my arm, and the world around me dissolved into a kaleidoscope of colors.</p>\n",
              "<p>I emerged into a world untouched by time. Sunlight filtered through the leaves of ancient trees, painting dappled patterns on the moss-covered cobblestones.

              "<p>With Elara as my guide, I embarked on a quest to restore the city's ancient magic. We navigated treacherous landscapes, battled grotesque creatures, and solved riddles etched in the city’s forgotten language. I learned to harness the key's energy, its power growing stronger with each challenge I overcame.</p>\n",
              "<p>The journey was fraught with danger, but also filled with wonder. I saw wonders I never imagined, encountered creatures both beautiful and terrifying, and learned lessons about courage, sacrifice, and the power of belief. </p>\n",
              "<p>Finally, we faced the source of the threat, a being of pure darkness consumed by its own rage. The battle was fierce, but using the key’s power, I channeled a torrent of energy, pushing back the darkness and restoring the city's forgotten magic. </p>\n",
              "<p>As the city shimmered back to life, bathed in the gentle glow of its magic, I felt a profound sense of peace. I had found a world beyond my wildest dreams, and in doing so, I had found a part of myself I never knew existed.</p>\n",

              "<li><strong>Holding Platforms Accountable:</strong> Social media companies need to be held responsible for combating misinformation, hate speech, and the spread of extremist content. This could involve stricter content moderation policies and transparency about algorithm design.</li>\n",

              "<ul>\n",
              "<li><strong>Geographical Isolation:</strong> The Roman Empire's vastness meant different regions developed their own unique dialects.  Isolation due to natural barriers, political boundaries, or migrations contributed to distinct vocabularies, pronunciations, and grammatical structures.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Contact with other Languages:</strong>  As the empire crumbled, different regions came into contact with other languages (e.g., Germanic in the north, Arabic in the south).  Borrowings and linguistic influences reshaped the languages.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Social and Political Factors:</strong> Changes in social structure, political shifts, and the rise of new centers of power (e.g., the Frankish kingdom in France) led to language standardization and the emergence of distinct literary traditions.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Phonetic Drift:</strong>  Over time, subtle changes in pronunciation accumulated, altering the sound system and leading to diverging phonological systems.</li>\n",

              "<ul>\n",
              "<li><strong>Shared Vocabulary:</strong> Despite the divergence, Romance languages share a core vocabulary derived from Latin. While some words have evolved differently, their origins are traceable to Latin roots.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Grammatical Structure:</strong>  While grammatical rules have evolved, a basic underlying structure derived from Latin is evident in all Romance languages.  This includes elements like verb conjugation patterns and noun declensions.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Latin Influences:</strong> Even in borrowed words and linguistic structures, Latin influence is discernible, demonstrating the enduring legacy of the source language.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Shared Cultural Heritage:</strong>  The Romance languages are bound together by a shared cultural heritage, expressed in literature, art, and traditions.</li>\n",

              "<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n",
              "<ul>\n",
              "<li><strong>Spanish and Portuguese:</strong>  While closely related, they exhibit distinct pronunciations and vocabularies, partly due to Arabic influences on Portuguese.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>French and Italian:</strong>  Both languages retain Latin grammatical structures, but have significantly different pronunciations, particularly with vowel sounds.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Romanian:</strong>  As the easternmost Romance language, Romanian shows greater influence from Slavic languages.</li>\n",

While geographical isolation, language contact, and social shifts led to divergence, a shared vocabulary, grammatical structure, and cultural heritage bind these languages together, making them a testament to the dynamism of language evolution.

This discomfort arises from the inherent need for consistency in our thoughts and actions. When our beliefs clash with our actions, or when we face contradictory information, dissonance arises, driving us to seek ways to restore mental harmony.</p>\n",

              "<p><strong>1. Changing Beliefs:</strong> This involves altering one of the conflicting beliefs to align with the other. For example, a smoker who is aware of the health risks associated with smoking might downplay the seriousness of the risks or convince themselves that they are not at significant risk.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>2. Changing Behavior:</strong> This involves modifying actions to align with existing beliefs. For example, someone who believes in healthy eating but frequently consumes fast food might switch to a healthier diet.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>3. Adding New Information:</strong> This involves seeking out information that supports one of the existing beliefs and contradicts the conflicting one. For example, a person who has doubts about climate change might seek out information that downplays its severity.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>4. Reducing the Importance of the Conflict:</strong> This involves minimizing the significance of the conflicting beliefs or actions. For example, a student who procrastinates on their assignments might justify it by arguing that it doesn't impact their overall performance significantly.</p>\n",

              "<p><strong>1. Confirmation Bias:</strong> We tend to seek out information that confirms our existing beliefs and avoid information that challenges them. This reinforces our existing viewpoints, making it difficult to change our minds even when presented with contrary evidence.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>2. Rationalization:</strong> We may justify our actions or beliefs to avoid the discomfort of dissonance. This can lead to poor decision-making as we prioritize preserving our mental comfort over making rational choices.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>3. Resistance to Change:</strong> Dissonance can make us resistant to changing our beliefs or behaviors, even when it's in our best interest. This can hinder personal growth and lead to stagnation.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>4. Justification of Effort:</strong> We may overvalue a goal or decision if we put a significant amount of effort into it. This is because we want to justify the effort we have invested, even if the outcome is undesirable.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>5. Increased Conformity:</strong>  We are more likely to conform to group norms and behaviors to avoid dissonance, even if those norms contradict our personal beliefs.</p>\n",

It reflects the dynamism of social structures and the potential for individuals to improve their lives. However, the extent and nature of social mobility vary significantly across different societies and time periods, raising questions about its impact on social equality.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>Factors Contributing to Upward Mobility:</strong></p>\n",
              "<ul>\n",
              "<li><strong>Education:</strong> Access to quality education remains a crucial driver of upward mobility. A well-educated workforce is essential for economic growth, and individuals with higher levels of education tend to earn more and have greater access to opportunities.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> Expanding economies typically create more opportunities for advancement. This can translate into increased job availability, higher wages, and greater access to resources.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Government Policies:</strong> Policies aimed at promoting equality, such as affirmative action, social welfare programs, and affordable housing, can create pathways for upward mobility, especially for marginalized groups.</li>\n",

If upward mobility is primarily accessible to privileged groups, it can further entrench social stratification.</li>\n",

              "<p>F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" is a poignant exploration of the American Dream's elusive nature, set against the backdrop of the Roaring Twenties.  The novel, through its intricate plot, layered characters, and rich symbolism, poignantly critiques the pursuit of wealth and status, highlighting the hollowness beneath the glittering façade of the Jazz Age.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>Literary Devices:</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>Fitzgerald masterfully employs several literary devices to enhance the narrative:</p>\n",
              "<ul>\n",
              "<li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> The green light across the bay serves as a potent symbol of Gatsby's unattainable desire for Daisy, representing both his yearning for the past and the elusive nature of the American Dream. The valley of ashes, a desolate wasteland, represents the moral decay and disillusionment of the era, a stark contrast to the extravagant parties.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Foreshadowing:</strong> The novel is riddled with foreshadowing, starting with the opening lines hinting at Gatsby's tragic fate. Nick's initial impressions of Gatsby, his mysterious past, and the growing tension between Gatsby and Tom Buchanan all foreshadow the tragic climax.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Irony:</strong> The novel is rife with irony, most notably the irony of Gatsby's lavish parties, where he desperately seeks connection yet remains utterly isolated. The irony of Gatsby's wealth built on illegal activities further underscores the hollowness of his American Dream.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>First-person narration:</strong> Nick Carraway, a detached observer, narrates the story, providing a unique and often unreliable perspective. His internal struggles and evolving opinions about Gatsby and the other characters add depth and complexity to the narrative.</li>\n",
              "</ul>\n",
              "<p><strong>Thematic Elements:</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>\"The Great Gatsby\" explores several important themes:</p>\n",
              "<ul>\n",
              "<li><strong>The American Dream:</strong> The novel critiques the American Dream's unattainable nature, exposing its corruption and the societal inequalities that make it elusive for many. Gatsby's obsession with Daisy, who represents the past and a romanticized vision of the Dream, ultimately leads to his downfall.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Love and Loss:</strong> Gatsby's love for Daisy is a consuming passion, fueled by nostalgia and idealized memories. His pursuit of her ultimately leads to tragedy, as his efforts to recapture the past prove futile. </li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Social Class and Inequality:</strong> The novel starkly depicts the class divisions of the Jazz Age, highlighting the privileges enjoyed by the wealthy elite like Tom Buchanan and the struggles of those who aspire to join their ranks like Gatsby. The stark contrast between West Egg and the Valley of Ashes emphasizes the widening gap between rich and poor.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>The Corruption of the American Dream:</strong> Gatsby's wealth, built on illegal activities, symbolizes the moral corruption that permeates the pursuit of the American Dream. The novel warns against the dangers of chasing material success at any cost, exposing the emptiness that can result.</li>\n",
              "</ul>\n",
              "<p><strong>Cultural Context:</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>\"The Great Gatsby\" was written in the aftermath of World War I, during a period of economic prosperity and social upheaval known as the Jazz Age. The novel reflects the era's hedonism, materialism, and fascination with wealth and celebrity, but also its underlying social and moral decay. Fitzgerald, himself a product of this era, offers a critique of the American Dream, exposing its limitations and the disillusionment that it could bring.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>\"The Great Gatsby\" remains a timeless classic, its enduring relevance stemming from its insightful exploration of the American Dream, love, loss, and the societal issues that plague humanity. Through its masterful use of literary devices and its exploration of complex themes, the novel continues to resonate with readers today, providing a poignant reflection on the fragility of human dreams and the elusive nature of happiness. </p></div>\n",

              "<p>Claude Debussy's \"Clair de Lune,\" from his \"Suite Bergamasque,\" is a masterpiece of impressionistic piano music. Composed in 1905, this piece transcends mere technical prowess to evoke a haunting atmosphere of moonlit night and melancholic beauty.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>Musical Elements:</strong></p>\n",
              "<ul>\n",
              "<li><strong>Melody:</strong> The melody of \"Clair de Lune\" is simple yet exquisitely crafted. Its flowing, lyrical nature, characterized by sweeping arpeggios and chromaticism, evokes a sense of ethereal beauty and dreamy nostalgia. </li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Harmony:</strong> Debussy employs a rich and nuanced harmonic language, avoiding traditional tonal centers and utilizing ambiguous chords to create a sense of atmospheric ambiguity. The use of whole-tone scales and parallel chords reinforces the dreamlike quality of the piece.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Rhythm:</strong> The rhythmic structure of \"Clair de Lune\" is fluid and flexible, shifting subtly throughout. The use of rubato (flexible tempo) further adds to the piece's expressive nature.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Dynamics:</strong> The dynamic range of \"Clair de Lune\" is subtle and nuanced, with quiet passages contrasted by moments of hushed intensity. This subtle interplay adds depth and emotional richness to the piece.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Instrumentation:</strong>  The piece is written for solo piano, allowing Debussy to fully explore the expressive capabilities of the instrument. The piano's delicate touch and shimmering tone perfectly capture the ethereal mood of the piece.</li>\n",
              "</ul>\n",
              "<p><strong>Historical Context:</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>\"Clair de Lune\" was composed during a pivotal period in music history, marked by a shift away from the strictness of Romanticism and towards the exploration of new sounds and expressive possibilities.  Debussy, a prominent figure in the impressionist movement, sought to capture fleeting moments and evoke emotions through evocative sound. The piece reflects the changing aesthetic sensibilities of the time, emphasizing atmosphere and suggestion over overt emotionality.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>Emotional Impact:</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>\"Clair de Lune\" is a piece steeped in melancholy and introspection. Its ethereal beauty and dreamlike quality evoke a sense of longing, wistfulness, and poignant reflection. The piece's slow tempo and subtle dynamics create a sense of suspended time, allowing the listener to lose themselves in the piece's hypnotic atmosphere. The piece's ambiguity allows for individual interpretation, making it a deeply personal and emotionally resonant experience for each listener.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>\"Clair de Lune\" is a timeless masterpiece that transcends genre and time.  Its musical elements, combined with the historical context of its creation, create a unique and unforgettable musical experience. The piece's haunting beauty, evocative atmosphere, and emotional depth continue to resonate with audiences over a century after its composition, making it a testament to Debussy's enduring genius. </p></div>\n",

The objects representing time in this painting are the melting clocks, which are the most prominent and iconic symbols. They are portrayed as drooping and slumping, defying the laws of gravity and suggesting the fluidity and unreliability of time. </p>\n",
              "<p>Here's a breakdown of how these melting clocks represent time:</p>\n",
              "<ul>\n",
              "<li><strong>Melting:</strong> The clocks are not solid and rigid, but rather soft and malleable, resembling melting cheese or wax. This symbolizes the way time can seem to slip away or become distorted in our perception, especially during dreams or moments of intense emotion.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Drooping and Slumping:</strong> The clocks hang limply, as if their internal mechanisms have ceased functioning. This conveys the feeling of time slowing down or even stopping, a theme that Dalí often explored in his works.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Unusual Shapes:</strong> The clocks are not traditional, round timepieces, but rather irregular, abstract forms. This further emphasizes the subjective nature of time and how it can be perceived in different ways.</li>\n",
              "<li><strong>Placement:</strong> The clocks are scattered across the canvas, seemingly melting onto various surfaces. They are not confined to a particular space or location, suggesting the omnipresence of time and its ability to affect everything around us. </li>\n",
              "</ul>\n",
              "<p>The melting clocks in this painting are not simply clocks, but rather visual metaphors for the passage of time and its elusive nature. Dalí uses them to explore the subconscious and the fragility of human experience, questioning the very nature of reality itself. </p></div>\n",
