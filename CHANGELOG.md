# Changelog

Since the creation of this repository, the world of AI has been evolving at full speed. As such, this repository has been continually updated and upgraded.
This changelog contains the notable updates to the Transformers for NLP and Computer Vision 3rd Edition repository to adapt to the 
fast-evolving Generative AI market **after October 29, 2024**.

**Before October 29, 2024, the repository was also continually updated.** You can rely on the icons in front of the notebooks in the README.md file:   
Look for üê¨ to explore *new bonus notebooks* such as OpenAI o1's reasoning models, Midjourney's API, Google Vertex AI Gemini's API, OpenAI asynchronous batch API calls!           
Look for üéè to explore existing notebooks for the *latest model or platform releases*, such as OpenAI's latest GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini models.  
Look for üõ† to run existing notebooks with *new dependency versions and platform API constraints and tweaks.*

### Added
`Chapter06/KantaiBERT.ipynb` and `Chapter06/Customer_Support_for_X.ipynb` enhancement:    
**wandb.ai training metrics** added while training. 
You can now view your model's metrics on **Hugging Face**.

### Upgraded      

`Chapter14/Google_Vertex_AI.ipynb` has now been upgraded to `Chapter14/Google_Vertex_AI_Gemini.ipynb` with the `gemini-1.5-flash-001` model. 
A timer has been added to adapt to the API call rates.
It is recommended to read `Google_Vertex_AI.ipynb` with the chapter in the book to understand the process but then to run `Google_Vertex_AI_Gemini.ipynb` which now has LLM tasks and a computer vision task.

### Fixed
Fixed typo in `Chapter04/WMT_translations.ipynb`:   
Now, "smoothing" is correctly written in one of the print instructions.
