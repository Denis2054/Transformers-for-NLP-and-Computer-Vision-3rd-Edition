              "\"COVID-19 had several impacts on the 2022 Winter Olympics. The pandemic resulted in changes to the qualifying process for curling and women's ice hockey due to the cancellation of tournaments in 2020. Qualification for curling was based on placement in the 2021 World Curling Championships and an Olympic Qualification Event. The IIHF based its qualification for the women's tournament on existing IIHF World Rankings. Biosecurity protocols were implemented, requiring athletes to remain within a bio-secure bubble, undergo daily COVID-19 testing, and only travel to and from Games-related venues. Only residents of China were permitted to attend the Games as spectators. The NHL and NHLPA withdrew their players' participation in the men's hockey tournament. Ticket sales to the general public were canceled, and limited numbers of spectators were admitted by invitation only. The My2022 mobile app was used for health reporting and vaccination records. Some top athletes, including Marita Kramer and Nikita Tregubov, were unable to travel to China after testing positive for COVID-19.\""
